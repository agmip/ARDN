# AgMIP End-User Translation Tools

AgMIP data formats were developed to store and transfer data related to field crop experiments, farm surveys, and other agronomic data in an efficient, flexible format (Porter et al, 2014). AgMIP crop modeling protocols promote the use of multiple models for research applications (Rosenzweig et al, 2012). The AgMIP data products were originally developed to allow data from diverse sources to be harmonized using a common vocabulary, to be combined with expert knowledge, and to be translated equivalently to the model-specific formats used by individual crop models (Figure 1).
