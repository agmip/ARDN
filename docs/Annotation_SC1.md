# ARDN Sidecar File 1

Sidecar file 1 (SC1) provides a map of column data headers to ontology terms from AgrO, UO, CO, TO, ENVO , and other ontologies as needed. These mappings allow semantic linkage for all qualifying datasets. Quantitative data must be mapped to at least two ontological terms: at least one that describes the data and at least one that describes the units of measurement. In addition to variable mapping, SC1 files contain metadata which describe who generated the dataset annotation, the source location of the raw data, the content of the file, and where data are located in the file. This file was designed to be generated by the [COPO data annotation tools](https://copo-project.org/). 

The following is a partial SC1 for the [“TAMASA Ethiopia. Variety phenology calibration dataset, 2016”](https://gardian.bigdata.cgiar.org/dataset.php?id=5cd88b72317da7f1ae0cf390#!/). The file has been shortened for brevity. The entire file may be viewed **[here](https://github.com/agmip/gardian_metadata/blob/master/TAMASA/tamasa-sc1.json)**.
