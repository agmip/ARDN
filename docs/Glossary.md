# Glossary and References

**AgMIP** â€“ [Agricultural Model Intercomparison and Improvement Project](https://agmip.org/). Much of the groundwork for ARDN was developed as part of the AgMIP Data Interoperability protocols. These protocols specify standard formats and vocabularies which were developed to facilitate ensemble modeling activities. Crop modeling groups collaborated to develop the protocols and to develop software tools for data translation to specific model formats.
