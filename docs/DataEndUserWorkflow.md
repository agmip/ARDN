# Data End User Workflow

After a dataset has been annotated with an ARDN SC2 file (i.e., ARDN-ized), the data can be translated to AgMIP format (ACEB). ACEB files can then be translated to multiple end-user formats using the AgMIP data translation tools.

Links to additional resources for end users of ARDN data:

- Please refer to the [Documentation for AgMIP End-User Translation Tools](https://agmip.github.io/AgMIP_translators.html) on the AgMIP documentation site.

- You can download the [instructions and data files](https://github.com/agmip/ARDN/raw/master/docs/extras/Data_Factory_Exercise.zip) to run a translation sample through the Data Factory to convert data from AgMIP ACEB format to DSSAT format. This exercise builds on the [VMapper exercise](https://github.com/agmip/ARDN/raw/master/docs/extras/VMapper_Exercise.zip).

- [AgMIP data tools](http://tools.agmip.org/) - Download the latest QuadUI and other AgMIP data interoperability tools.
