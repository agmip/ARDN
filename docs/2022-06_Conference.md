# ARDN Data Interoperability Conference 
### June 9, 2022

The Agricultural Research Data network (ARDN) will hold a conference on Thursday, June 9, 2022 at the National Agricultural Library in Beltsville, Maryland on agricultural data interoperability. The ARDN project team will describe the methods developed for data annotation and sharing and describe the implementation on Ag Data Commons and GARDIAN data portals. We will discuss with conference participants ways of furthering this work with potential collaborations and implementation.

The one-day conference will be preceded by two hands-on data workshops. On Tuesday, June 7, the ARDN Data Providers Workshop presents the ARDN data annotation concepts and allows users to prepare their own data (or data provided by us) for inclusion in ARDN. On Wednesday, June 8, the ARDN Data User's Workshop will Participants will work with ARDN data in modeling applications.
