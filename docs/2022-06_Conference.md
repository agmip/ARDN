# ARDN Data Interoperability Conference 

The Agricultural Research Data network (ARDN) will hold a conference on Thursday, June 9, 2022 at the National Agricultural Library in Beltsville, Maryland, USA to showcase ARDN data interoperability tools and protocols. The ARDN project team will describe methods developed for data annotation and sharing which can be used to “rescue” legacy data or be applied to new data sources to facilitate interoperability and reuse of our most valuable agricultural research product: data. We will describe ARDN implementation on NAL's Ag Data Commons and CGIAR's GARDIAN data portals and discuss with conference participants ways of furthering this work through potential collaborations.
