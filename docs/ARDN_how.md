# How does ARDN work?

The ARDN data interoperability system is comprised of tools (orange boxes in diagram), and files (blue boxes). 
The tools are used to create the annotation files (Sidecar files 1, 2, and 3), the AgMIP format data file (ACEB), and the data in user-selected output formats (End User files).
A data provider uses the VMapper tool to map the variables in their data. Currently Excel and csv formats are supported by VMapper.
